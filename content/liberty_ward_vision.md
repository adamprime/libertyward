*from Bishop Wheeler, January 5, 2019*

Brothers and Sisters, I would encourage each of you to take some time to ponder, discuss, and determine what your family goals and plan will be to help the work of salvation in this year.  We have been asked by our area president to focus on the following 4 areas:

* Missionary Work
* Temple and Family History Work
* Ministering
* Keeping the Sabbath day holy
 
As a ward council we have pondered, prayed and discussed how this can apply to the Liberty Ward.  Here is our Liberty Ward Vision and Plan: 

## Vision

Joyfully invite all of God’s children to come unto Christ and join with us in the blessings available on the covenant path.

### What we will do:

Each family will create and follow a Family Work of Salvation Plan.

* Do something each week to more fully keep our covenants with the Lord
  * What am I currently doing that I need to stop doing?
  * What am I not currently doing that I need to start doing?
  * What am I currently doing that I need to continue?
* Participate in Temple and Family History Work monthly.
* Invite others into our lives monthly.
 
We, as a ward council, have felt strongly that most of the blessings will come as each family seeks revelation and determines the things that they can and should do to participate in the work of salvation. 
 
I strongly encourage you to take the time this next week to do this.  As you begin to act in faith and follow that guidance that the Lord will give each of you, I promise that our homes will be full of the Spirit, our worship services will uplifting, we will each find joy in our lives, and we will be able to share that joy with others.

This blessing I leave with you, in Jesus Christ’s name. Amen.
