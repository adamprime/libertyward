**To the Members of the Liberty Missouri Stake**

Dear Members,

As stated in Moses 1:39, the work and glory of God the Father and His son Jesus Christ is “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man”. Bringing to pass the eternal life of all of God’s children has always been a primary focus of the church. This is principally accomplished through proclaiming the gospel and inviting all of God’s children on both sides of the veil to repent and come unto Christ by receiving the gospel and all the saving ordinances.

Our beloved prophet, Russell M. Nelson, continues to answer that call, and extend a reminder to every member of the Church of the obligations we have in accomplishing and being about the work of the Father. In this effort we bear our witness that the keys of the Priesthood in the Liberty Missouri Stake are in full alignment with those of the Area Presidency, Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the First Presidency.

In The Book of Alma, chapter six, Alma is engaged in organizing and cleansing the church and setting things in order. In verse six we read, “Nevertheless the children of God were commanded that they should gather themselves together oft, and join in fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who knew not God.” Like the church in the days of Alma, we too have been commanded to gather together often (monthly) for the single purpose of joining in fasting and mighty prayer.

Brothers and Sisters, as we pondered and discussed this scripture as a presidency, the spirit bore a powerful witness that the Liberty Missouri Stake should do the same. We bear our witness that as we join together monthly as individuals, families, Wards, and a Stake in fasting and mighty prayer for the welfare of the souls of those who are less active and those who know not God, that the Lord will open the windows of heaven and poor his blessings out upon this area. To this end, we invite all members to join together every month in fasting and mighty prayer to know how each of us can be more fully engaged in sharing the gospel. As individual members and families, you will receive the personal revelation you seek and need in your lives. This revelation will guide you in what you can do to be more fully engaged in the work of the Father and specifically in missionary work. 

We testify that through earnest fasting and mighty prayer for missionary opportunities that the Lord will lead us to those who are prepared to accept His invitation to repent and come unto Christ. We bear you our witness that this is the “work and the glory” of the Father and the Son. What an incredible blessing and opportunity it is to live in these the last days where we are directly engaged in a hastening of the work and ushering in the return of our Savior Jesus Christ.

We love you; and bless you through your efforts in this marvelous work.

Faithfully your Brethren, <br>
