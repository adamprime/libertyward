Paul Farnsworth will again host this activity in his home. Bring your laptop and some dessert pie to share. Pizza pie will be provided to eat while we Index or do other Family History Work. Water will be provided, or BYOD. We'll enjoy the desert pie to conclude our evening of service and brotherhood.
