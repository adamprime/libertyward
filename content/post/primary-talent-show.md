2. as a table display
3. or on the stage

Submit by Feb 24th to loveablelucie@gmail.com or alpalmer8@gmail.com:

1. What format you will be using to share your talent (video, table display, stage)
2. What your talent will be (i.e.- what will you be displaying on the table, what is in your video what will you be doing on stage).
3. The names of the people that will be involved in the talent.

Submit the actual video footage on Feb24th, if you want to use that platform, so we have time to compile all the videos into one.
