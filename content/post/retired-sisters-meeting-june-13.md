Would you like to get together on a “regular” basis to do service, attend the temple, socialize, walk, bike, ???? What shoes do you want to wear?

We are having an “organization” meeting where we will be a discussing and brainstorming to see if this type of group would serve the interests/needs of the sisters in our stake and what you would want to do as a group.  Come and Bring a Friend.

Location: Liberty Stake Center  
Date and time: June 13, 10:00-11:00am
