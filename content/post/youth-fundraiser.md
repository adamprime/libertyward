## Enjoy a delicious dinner and bid on goods and service from the youth in this fun, family evening

Friday, March 1 at the Clayview Building

Enjoy a home cooked dinner for $5 per person or $25 per family. A silent auction will be held for home baked desserts and other delicacies, as well as a live auction for in-person services. All funds raised go to support the young men and young women to attend summer camps and boy scout camps.
