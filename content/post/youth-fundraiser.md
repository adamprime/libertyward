## Enjoy a delicious dinner and bid on goods and service from the youth in this fun, family evening

Friday, April 5 at the Clayview Building

Enjoy a home cooked dinner for $5 per person or $25 per family. A silent auction will be held for home baked desserts and other delicacies, as well as a live auction for in-person services. All funds raised go to support the young men and young women to attend summer camps and boy scout camps.

Have an item or service you would like to donate? Please email Bro. Dawson at libertywardclerk@gmail.com and he will make sure it is included!
